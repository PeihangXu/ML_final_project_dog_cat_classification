## Project Files
The compressed project zip file should contain the following files and folders:
* Final_project_distinguish_cat_dog.ipynb
* cat-and-dog.zip
* requirements.txt

## Setup environment
If using conda, you can use `*-requirements.txt` files to setup the new environment (e.g. `final_pr`)

```
    $ conda create final_pr --file conda-requirements.txt
    $ conda activate final_pr
```

## Prepare dataset
The dataset contains 10,000 pictures of cats and dogs which are compressed into `cat-and-dog.zip` file. First download [cat-and-dog](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WD-mIxmHIGAQdgymYbPH2vPvyshb9TnK) zip file and then unzip `cat-and-dog.zip` and the dataset is ready to be used. Make sure to unzip in the same folder as the project's `.ipynb` file.

## dumps
To save time, `*.h5` files for each model are stored in `dumps` folder. `.pkl` files can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BfhHTUEr_LsjI0S4i02OZMbJug4jNEBP)
